The code follows standard Python conventions (PEP 8). It uses a class-based structure (`FcbgaModeler`) to encapsulate the modeling logic. Naming conventions are critical for HFSS compatibility: all entity names must be sanitized to contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. The code is well-documented with docstrings and inline comments explaining complex calculations and HFSS-specific operations.
